### 문제 설명

<p>In St Petersburg phone numbers are formatted as “XXX–XX–XX”, where the first three digits represent index of the Automated Telephone Exchange (ATE). Each ATE has exactly 10 000 unique phone numbers.</p>

<p>Peter has just bought a new flat and now he wants to install a telephone line. He thinks that a phone number is lucky if the arithmetic expression represented by that phone number is equal to zero. For example, the phone number 102–40–62 is lucky (102 − 40 − 62 = 0), and the number 157–10–47 is not lucky (157 − 10 − 47 = 100 ≠ 0).</p>

<p>Peter knows the index of the ATE that serves his house. To get an idea of his chances to get a lucky number he wants to know how many lucky numbers his ATE has.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input file contains a single integer number n — the index of Peter’s ATE (100 ≤ n ≤ 999).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single integer number — the number of lucky phone numbers Peter’s ATE has.</p>
